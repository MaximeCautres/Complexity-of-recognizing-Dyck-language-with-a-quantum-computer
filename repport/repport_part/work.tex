\subsection{A better complexity analysis of the original algorithm}

In the article \cite{art:2DGrid}, Andris Ambainis's team gave a quantum query
algorithm to recognize $\Dyck{k}$ that uses $O(\sqrt{n}(\log_2(n))^{0.5k})$
quantum queries. But the quantum query complexity for $k=1$
($O\left(\sqrt{n\log_2(n)}\right)$) is not as good as a Grover's search
$O(\sqrt{n})$ which is sufficient (seen in \autoref{already_known}).
More precisely, the logarithmic search done by \FA{k+1} for $k=1$ is useless
as there is exactly one minimal $\pm 2$ -string. So, it is sufficient to
add a new initial case to \FA{k+1} for $k = 1$ in order to use a Grover search
for $00$ and $11$ in $1w0$ instead of \FFL{2}. This small revision has lowered
the quantum query complexity for $k=1$ of the function to $O(\sqrt{n})$ instead
of $O(\sqrt{n\log_2(n)})$. This gives the following algorithm for \FA{k}

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{\FA{k}(l,r,s)}\label{alg:FA_prim}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \Require $0 \leq l < r$ and $s \subseteq \{1,-1\}$
        \If{$k > 2$}
        \State \textbf{Find} $d$ in $\{2^{\lceil \log_2(k)\rceil }, 2^{\lceil \log_2(k)+1\rceil },\ldots,2^{\lceil \log_2(r-l)\rceil }\}$
        such that \\
        \hspace*{1cm} $v_d \gets $ \FFL{k}$(l,r,d,s)$ is \textbf{not} \Null
        \State \textbf{return} $v_d$ or \Null \ if none
        \Else
        \State \textbf{Find} $t$ in $\{l, l+1, \dots, r\}$ such that \\
        \hspace*{1cm} $v_t \gets$ \FALM{2}$(l,r,t,2,s)$ is \textbf{not} \Null
        \State \textbf{return} $v_t$ of \Null \ if none.
        \EndIf
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The same improvements can be done on \FFP{k} because if $k = 2$ the logarithmic
search is useless. So \FFP{k} can be redefined as in
\textsc{Algorithm}\autoref{alg:ffp_better}. For $k=2$, the complexity is
lowered from $O(\sqrt{\log_2(l-r)})$ to $O(1)$.

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{$\FFP{k}(l,r,t,s)$}\label{alg:ffp_better}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \Require $0\leq l<r$, $l \leq t \leq r$ and $s \subseteq \{1, -1\}$
        \If{$k>2$}
        \State \textbf{Find} $d$ in $\{2^{\lceil \log_2(k)\rceil }, 2^{\lceil \log_2(k)+1\rceil },\ldots,2^{\lceil \log_2(r-l)\rceil }\}$
        such that \\
        \hspace*{1cm} $v_d \gets $ \FALM{k}$(l,r,t,d,s)$ is \textbf{not} \Null
        \State \textbf{return} $v_d$ or \Null \ if none
        \Else
        \ $v \gets $ \FALM{k}$(l,r,t,2,s)$ is \textbf{not} \Null
        \State \textbf{return} $v_d$ or \Null \ if none
        \EndIf
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This small improvements on two initial cases improve the global
quantum query complexity of each subroutine and finally the quantum
query complexity for \Dyck{k}.

\begin{theorem}{\textbf{\Dyck{k}'s algorithm correctness}} \label{th:subroutine_correctness}
    The new definitions of \FA{} and \FFP{} do not change the behavior the original algorithm
    as other subroutines (\autoref{annex:complete_subroutine_dyck_kn}) stay unchanged.
\end{theorem}

\begin{tproof}
    The behavior of the \Dyck{k} algorithm with the new subroutines hasn't changed
    as \FA{} (resp. \FF{}) has the same sub-behavior on every entry than its
    former definition.

    \qed
\end{tproof}

\begin{theorem}{\textbf{\Dyck{k}'s subroutines complexity}} \label{th:subroutine_complexity}
    The quantum query complexity of \Dyck{k} algorithm's subroutines are the following.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $Q$(\Dyck{k}) = $O\left(\sqrt{n}(\log_2(n))^{0.5(k-1)}\right)$ \ for $k \geq 1$
        \item $Q$(\FA{k+1}$(l,r,s)$) = $O\left(\sqrt{r-l}(\log_2(r-l))^{0.5(k-1)}\right)$ \ for $k \geq 1$
        \item $Q$(\FFL{k+1}$(l,r,d,s)$) = $O\left(\sqrt{r-l}(\log_2(r-l))^{0.5(k-2)}\right)$ \ for $k \geq 2$
        \item $Q$(\FALM{k+1}$(l, r, t, d, s)$) = $\left\{
                  \begin{array}{ll}
                      O\left(\sqrt{d}(\log_2(d))^{0.5(k-2)}\right) & \textrm{for} \ k \geq 2 \\
                      O(1)                                         & \textrm{for} \  k = 1
                  \end{array}
                  \right.$
        \item $Q$(\FF{k}$(l,r,s, left)$) = $O\left(\sqrt{r-l}(\log_2(r-l))^{0.5(k-2)}\right)$ \ for $k \geq 2$
        \item $Q$(\FFP{k}$(l,r,t,s)$) = $\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                      O\left(\sqrt{r-l}(\log_2(r-l))^{0.5(k-2)}\right) & \textrm{for} \ k \geq 3 \\
                      O(1)                                             & \textrm{for} \ k = 2
                  \end{array}
                  \right.$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{tproof}
    The idea is that only the $O\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$ comes from the initial
    case for $k = 1$ and that each of the $k-1$ level of the recursion increases
    the final quantum query complexity with a $O\left(\sqrt{\log_2(n)}\right)$
    factor. The $O\left(\sqrt{\log_2(n)}\right)$ factor is proven by Andris
    Ambainis' team in \cite{art:2DGrid} while the $O\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$
    for $k = 1$ comes from the new version of \FA{k} (\textsc{Algorithm}
    \autoref{alg:ffp_better}). The complete proof for the theorem is given
    in \autoref{proof:complexity_dyckkn}.

    \qed
\end{tproof}

Unfortunately, the improvements done on the initial cases of some of
the subroutines are not sufficient to get a significant improvement
for the quantum query complexity of \Dyck{k} algorithm. However,
they are sufficient to match the theoretical upper bound gave by
the reduction.

\subsection{A new algorithm for \Dyck{2}}
\label{subsection:dyck2n}

First, we would like to find an algorithm with a quantum query complexity
near to match the lower bound describes by Andris
Ambainis' team in \cite{art:2DGrid}, $\exists c > 1$ such that
$Q\left(\Dyck{k}\right)=\Omega\left(\sqrt{n}c^k\right)$. So the
searched algorithm may have a quantum query complexity of
$O\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$.

For $k=1$, the query complexity comes only from a call to Grover's search.
For $k=2$ it no more possible to search for every minimal
$\pm 3$-strings without a linear number of call to Grover's search. So in
order to keep the quantum query complexity in $O\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$,
the algorithm should do a constant number of calls to Grover's search.

For that, we define a new alphabet that can express every even length
binary string and that has convenient properties for a Grover's search.
Let $\mathcal{A} = \{a, b, c, d\}$ be the alphabet where $a$ corresponds
to 00, $b$ to 11, $c$ to 01, and $d$ to 10. Every string of size 2 has
its associated letter in $\mathcal{A}$ thus every even length bit string
is expressed in $\mathcal{A}^*$. This alphabet allows to prove more easily
the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}{\textbf{Substrings rejection for Dyck word of height at most 2.}}
    A word on the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ embodies a Dyck word of
    height at most 2 if and only if it does not contain $aa, ac, bb,
        bd, cb, cd, da,$ or$ dc$ as a substring.
\end{theorem}

\begin{tproof}
    First, this alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ is important because each letter
    has a height variation in $\{-2, 0, 2\}$. Indeed, $a$ has a height
    variation of 2, $b$ of $-2$, $c$ of 0, and $d$ of 0.
    So, after each letter in a word, the current height will be even.
    Moreover, for a valid Dyck word of height at most 2, only 0 and 2
    are even and accessible heights. So after every
    letter in a word, the height will be 0 or 2 which are respectively
    the lower and the upper bound for the height.

    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \draw[<->, thick] (0, 3) -- (0, 0) -- (9, 0);
            \draw[dashed, red] (-.2, 1) --(9, 1);
            \draw[red] (-.2, 2) --(9, 2);
            \draw[red] (-.2, 0) --(9, 0);
            \draw[very thick, blue] (0, 0) -- (2, 2) -- (3, 1) -- (5, 3) -- (8, 0);
            \draw[blue, dashed] (2, -.2) -- (2, 3);
            \draw[blue, dashed] (4, -.2) -- (4, 3);
            \draw[blue, dashed] (6, -.2) -- (6, 3);
            \draw[blue, dashed] (8, -.2) -- (8, 3);
            \draw[blue] (1, 0) node[below] {$a$};
            \draw[blue] (3, 0) node[below] {$d$};
            \draw[blue] (5, 0) node[below] {$c$};
            \draw[blue] (7, 0) node[below] {$b$};
            \draw (0, 2) node[above left] {2};
            \draw (0, 0) node[above left] {0};
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{Illustration of the letters of $\mathcal{A}$ using Dyck's representation.}
        \label{tikz:dyck2alphabet}
    \end{figure}

    This property is important as it implies that every substrings that cross a
    bounds uses at least two letters. So it may be possible that the belonging
    of some pairs of letters to a word implies its non belonging to \Dyck{2}.
    It founds out that $\mathcal{A}^2$ can be split into two sets described
    in \autoref{tab:partitionDyck2}.

    \begin{table}[htb]
        \centering
        \caption{Partition of $\mathcal{A}$ into $\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{V}$.}
        \label{tab:partitionDyck2}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            $\mathcal{X}$ & $aa$ $ac$ $bb$ $bd$ $cb$ $cd$ $da$ $dc$ \\
            \hline
            $\mathcal{V}$ & $ab$ $ad$ $ba$ $bc$ $ca$ $cc$ $db$ $dd$ \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}


        \newpage
    \end{table}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The set $\mathcal{X}$. First, every couple of letters which
              contains a $\pm 3$-string is in $\mathcal{X}$. This first
              condition explains the belonging of $aa, ac, dc, da, cb, bb,
                  bd, \textrm{and}\ cd $. Next, $cd$ and $dc$ belong to
              $\mathcal{X}$. Indeed, for any valid Dyck word of
              height at most 2, the current height is bounded between 0 and 2.
              After each letter the current height is even so both couple $cd$
              and $dc$ start and finish on the same bound. However, $cd$
              and $dc$ are going above and below the height at which they start
              so both are going outside off the bounds. Thus, a word which
              contains $cd$ or $dc$ can not be a Dyck Word of height a most 2.
              The \autoref{fig:rejectDyck2} shows each couple of $\mathcal{X}$.

    So, a word in $\mathcal{A}^*$ that has a substring in $\mathcal{X}$
    cannot be a Dyck word of height two. But does every non Dyck word of height
    at most 2 has a substring in $\mathcal{X}$?

    A word is not a Dyck word of height at most 2 if it include a $\pm 3$-string. But how are represented $\pm 3$-strings using the letters?
    There are 8 different cases which are 2 by 2 symmetrical so
    \autoref{fig:p3string} and \autoref{fig:p3string2piece} show only the
    cases for $+3$-strings. In \autoref{fig:p3string}, every $+3$-string of
    size 3 is include in $aa$ or $ac$ so it is sufficient to search for this
    two couples. In \autoref{fig:p3string2piece} every $+3$-string of length
    greater than 3 is composed of 2 minimal $+2$-strings. It implies that
    one must be a $a$ while the other must be $da$
    of $dc$. Because $da$ or $dc$ are rejecting substrings, it is sufficient
    to search for them.

Finally, a word on the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ embodies a Dyck word of
height at most 2 if and only if it does not contain $aa, ac, bb, bd, cb, cd, da, dc$.
The following \textsc{Algorithm} \autoref{alg:dyck2nsqrt} for \Dyck{2}
comes from the direct application of the theorem.


\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{\textsc{DyckFast}$_{2,n}$}\label{alg:dyck2nsqrt}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \Require $n \geq 0$, $x$ such that  $|x| = 2n$
        \State $x \gets 11x00$
        \State $\texttt{t} \gets \Null$
        \For{$\texttt{reject\_symbol} \in \{aa, ac, bb, bd, cb, cd, da, dc\}$}
        \If{$t == \Null$}
        \State \textbf{Find} $\texttt{t}$ in $\llbracket0, n\rrbracket$ such that \\
        \hspace*{1cm} $x[2\texttt{t}+1, \ldots, 2\texttt{t}+4] = \texttt{reject\_symbol}$
        \EndIf
        \EndFor
        \State \textbf{return} $\texttt{t} == \Null$

    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{theorem}{\textbf{The quantum query complexity of \textsc{DyckFast}$_{2,n}$.}}
    The \textsc{DyckFast}$_{2,n}$ algorithm has a quantum query complexity of $O\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{tproof}
    The algorithm is doing at most 8 Grover's searches on the modified input
    string $11x00$. So the total quantum query complexity is
    \[Q(\textsc{DyckFast}_{2, n}) = 8\times O\left(\sqrt{n+4}\right) = O\left(\sqrt{n}\right).\]

    \qed
\end{tproof}

\subsection{A simplification for \Dyck{2} algorithm}

The algorithm describes in \autoref{subsection:dyck2n} is complex to explain
but it turns out that a simpler version of it exists and is really easier to
understand that the first one.

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{\textsc{DyckFastEasy}$_{2,n}$}\label{alg:dyck2nsqrteasy}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \Require $n \geq 0$, $x$ such that  $|x| = 2n$
        \State $x \gets 11x00$
        \State \textbf{Find} $\texttt{t}$ in $\llbracket1, n+1\rrbracket$ such that \\
        \hspace*{1cm} $x[2\texttt{t}, 2\texttt{t}+1] \in \{00, 11\}$
        \State \textbf{return} $\texttt{t} == \Null$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Lets explain how it works. A Dyck word of height at most 2 is recognized by
the following grammar on the alphabet $\{0, 1\}$:
\begin{align*}
    S & \mapsto 0I1                             \\
    I & \mapsto 01I \vert 10I \vert \varepsilon \\
\end{align*}
Indeed, a Dyck word of height at most 2 $w_1\ldots w_n$ can only start with
a zero else it gets a negative height. After, if it goes up, it reach the
height 2 so it can only go down. If it goes down instead of going up, it
reaches height 0 so it can only go up. This implies that after every letter
of odd indices, the height is equal to one, and that the next
two letters can only be in $\{01, 10\}$. So, finding a 00, or 11 starting
on an even index is equivalent to not being a dyck word of height at most two.
Finally, it becomes sufficient to use two Grover searches for 00 and 11
in order to recognize \Dyck{2,n}.

\subsection{A final improvement to \Dyck{k} algorithm}

The last algorithm describes is useful to recognize \Dyck{2}. However, it cannot
be plug into the huge one because it does not return the $\pm 3$-string that
allows it to reject. Indeed, the algorithm only finds the second $\pm 2$-string
of the $\pm 3$-string. So,in order to reduce the complexity of the main algorithm,
it is required to find the first  $\pm 2$-string. To do that, it is sufficient
to make a call to the already existing subroutines \FF{2} described in
\autoref{alg:FF} by asking for the closest $\pm 2$-string on the left of the
already known $\pm 2-$string. This is done with a quantum query complexity of
$O(\sqrt{n})$ (Computations are similar to the ones done in the proof in
\autoref{proof:complexity_dyckkn}). Thus, it is easy to modify a little
the algorithm \textsc{DyckFastEasy}{2,n} to return the $\pm 3$-string when
it rejects. Finally, it can be plug into the main algorithm, the computation
of the quantum query complexity are almost identical to the one done in
\autoref{proof:complexity_dyckkn} but initial case is for $k=2$ instead of $k=1$.
The consequence is the removing of a recursion step which implies the loss of
a $\sqrt{\log_2(n)}$ factor which bring the quantum query complexity of
the algorithm that recognizing \Dyck{k} to $O(\sqrt{n}(\log_2(n))^{0.5(k-2)})$.
