# Complexity of recognizing Dyck language with a quantum computer.

This repository contains every material, report and slide that I have used or written during my Master 1's internship. I was under the supervision of Andris Ambainis at the university of Latvia in the quantum computer science team. My internship last 12 weeks from 
May the 2nd 2022 to July the 22nd 2022.

My work focus on the quantum query algorithm and more precisely on 
the quantum query Complexity of recognizing Dyck languages
                of bounded height. Both concepts are really interesting and it has been exciting to made them join.
